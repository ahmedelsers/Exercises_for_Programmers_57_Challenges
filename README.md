# Exercises_for_Programmers_57_Challenges
This is a list of my answers in Python 3 to the exercises listed in "Exercises for Programmers 57 Challenges to Develop Your coding skills" Book, By "Brian P. Hogan"

Regarding the 05_simple_math_GUI.py solution, I understand it can be less complex than this, but I just needed to show what I know about Python 3 and tkinter, also to remind myself to stop using tkinter and go with a different GUI toolkit available for Python, and I think I'll go with PyQt5.

05_simple_math_GUI.py is my last GUI Python/Tkinter script, All coming exercises I'll use PyQt5/Qt Designer.
